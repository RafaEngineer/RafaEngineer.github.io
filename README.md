## Overview

A Vanilla Javascript project displaying a gallery of my repos from my GitHub portfolio.

### The challenge

Any visitors to the site should be able to:

- Click on any repos to see more details of each of my repositories.


### Links

- Live Site URL: https://anniecat73.github.io/github-repo-gallery/

## My process

- I first made sure I had some repos to show in my GitHub profile.
- I forked and cloned the files for my project.
-I studied the set-up to work out how I would approach it with Javascript.
- I then fetched the data from the GitHub API.
- I uploaded the GitHub Repo Gallery onto the web via GitHub Pages.

### Built with

- Provided HTML and CSS markup
- Vanilla Javascript 
- GitHub API

### What I learned

This was an opportunity to use and get more comfortable with the many features of Git and GitHub.
I got to practice with fetching information from an API and to integrate it into the project.

### Continued development

I will continue practising Javascript features such as events, functions, array, API and DOM manipulation.
